# ðŸ¤– triplej playlist generator ([live playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4wP3HpMngLebZ8pYvXD0Et?si=9f3747516a724f63))
Automatically generate a spotify playlist from the most recently played music on the [triplej radio station](https://www.abc.net.au/triplej).
## Getting Started
1. Register your application on the [developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and obtain the `client_id` and a `client_secret`.
2. Use the authorization code on the official spotify [web-api-auth-examples repo](https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples/tree/master/authorization_code) to obtain a `refresh_token`. Make sure to grant access to the correct playlist type when fetching this token. You can read about scopes [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/scopes/). As my playlist is public I only need the `playlist-modify-public` scope.
3. Create a playlist in spotify and copy the link to it. Note we just want the playlist_id which is the bold section of the following example url:
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/**4wP3HpMngLebZ8pYvXD0Et**?si=9f3747516a724f63
4. Edit the makefile and add the above config.
5. run `make`
